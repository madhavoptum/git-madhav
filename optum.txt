CVCS(CENTRAILIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM):

1. Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration. 
2. Unfortunately, if the central server goes down for an hour, then during that hour, no one can collaborate at all. 
3. even in a worst case, if the disk of the central server gets corrupted and proper backup has not been taken, then you will lose the entire history of the project
4. Here, distributed version control system (DVCS) comes into picture.

DVCS(DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM):

1. DVCS clients not only check out the latest snapshot of the directory but they also fully mirror the repository.
2. If the server goes down, then the repository from any client can be copied back to the server to restore it.
3. Every checkout is a full backup of the repository. 
4. You can commit changes, create branches, view logs, and perform other operations when you are offline
5. You require network connection only to publish your changes and take the latest changes.

Let us see the basic workflow of Git.

Step 1 − You modify a file from the working directory.

Step 2 − You add these files to the staging area.

Step 3 − You perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the Git repository.
